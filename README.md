# Login with Nuxt - home assignment

## Background
This is a test assignment for a job interview for a frontend position.

The original task:
>Create a client-side only rendered Nuxt 3 application that allows people to sign up for a product. If you don't have any experience with Nuxt 3, it's OK to only use Vue 3. The form should contain fields for email and password, which should be required and show an error if no value is entered. The password field should have a way to make the password visible. The user should be able to choose to receive occasional product updates and announcements. Once signed up, they should be presented with a success page.
>
>Please use the Provet Cloud Design System ([https://provetcloud.design/]) appropriately.
Read https://provetcloud.design/web-components/#installation-1 to learn how to use the Provet components in Vue. If possible, use TypeScript; however, JavaScript is also fine."
>
>Looking forward to seeing what you will come up with! Please keep in mind that we're looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer, so the solution should demonstrate such seniority level.
>
>Thank you and I'm looking forward to your response; good luck!

## Run locally
Since this is a nuxt project, you have to first install the dependencies by running `npm install` (or using your preferred package manager... for example, this project is using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/))

Afterwards, running the `dev` task should spin up the local dev server.
